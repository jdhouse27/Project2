# Project2
With this project we set out to create a site/application where users could create an account or log in to their account
to search a specific location (i.e. Kansas City) for something that interests them.  We set some examples up with a slider 
component for ease of use or the user could use the search bar.  This would display the top rated options according to the Yelp
ratings for the user to view and select to add to their custom itinerary.  Video Demo coming soon.
